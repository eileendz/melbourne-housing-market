# ETC3555 Final Project: Melbourne housing market

## Due Dates
Do not wait until the last minute.
-  September 12th: 5 pm: You have submitted your data set choice ranking.
-  October 24th: Present your slides in the lecture.
-  October 24th: 11:55pm: Upload to Moodle(i) your project report as pdf, one per
group, (ii) the slides for your presentation as pdf and (ii) a zip file of the source code R files you used to replicate the graphs in results in the report.

## Dataset
Melbourne Housing Auctions: This data-set list all sold houses from March 2016 to
December 2018 and the goal is to predict the sales price. Availability:

## The Task:
You have to build one neural network model with Keras and one benchmark model of your choosing and compare the prediction performance. It is your choice to select a loss function, a train test split, and how to evaluate the performance of your final model. The goal is not to build the best model possible, more the process how you got to your result and document this. You need to submit a short report (max 5 pages), a presentation (max 10 slides) and give a presentation (10 minutes) in week 12 during the lecture. Remember: Cite academic papers if you us the same architecture, loss functions etc.
  
  
## Project report and presentation
The data analysis report can be a maximum of 5 pages and must abide by the section structure described below.

### Section 1: Model
This section presents the learning problem and the models you have considered. Some of the questions you could answer include “what are the parameters/hyperparameters?”, “how do you optimize these parameters?”, “explain how these parameters control the complexity/flexibility of the algorithm”, “does your method scale well with large data sets?”, etc.

### Section 2: Experiment
This section describes the data set you have chosen or got assigned and the experiment you have performed, including a justification of your choices (evaluation metric, optimization procedure, etc). How did you select the benchmark method?

### Section 3: Results and Discussion
This includes for example graphs and tables, as well as a discussion of the results. You should also present your model fitting, diagnostics, etc.

### Section 4: Conclusion
This includes a summary of the findings.

## Grading
- Report: 80 
- Presentation: 20

For your report, you should clearly explain what you have done, using figures to supplement your explanation. Your figures must be of proper size with labelled, readable axes. In general, you should take pride in making your report readable and clear. You will be graded both on statically/machine learning content and quality of presentation.
For your presentation, score will be given by the lecturer and other students.
