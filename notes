nn is proved to be twice as accurate as the regression model (Tay and Ho, 1992) & (Do adn Grudnitski, 1992)

Worzala et al (1995) says the opposite thing: did not prove to be significantly better than the statistical apporach

Jenkin et al (1999): use the SOM for stratification of the data set. -> use it to uncover submarkets and construct independent MLP networks for each dataset. 

self-organising map: 
- mapping from a high-dimensional data spae onto a usual two-dimensional lattice of points. 

steps: 
- init: random value for each node 
- select training vector x 
- find the best matching neuron node c (based on minimising educlidian distance)
- adjust the node c towards the obs x

competitive learning
SOM seperate the market into sub-market and build independent MLP networks for each sub-market
